This is exactly the same repository as Master-thesis-Predicting-individual-immigration-attitudes-of-Europeans. The notebooks in the current repository are accessible directly via GitHub, whereas in as Master-thesis-Predicting-individual-immigration-attitudes-of-Europeans, three notebooks need to be downloaded in order to be opened.

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with Python code used in the master’s thesis “Predicting Individual Attitudes Towards Immigration in Europe”.

The project focuses on building and comparing multiple machine learning models trained on socio-demographic data as well as variables related to trust in public institutions, with the aim of predicting whether an individual is more supportive of or opposed to immigration.
